# Continuous-Feedback-App

## Objective
Developing a web application which enables users to provide continous feedback to an activity


## Description
The application must enable users to provide continuous feedback to a course or tutorial.

The application is built on a Single Page Application architecture and is accessible from the browser on the desktop, mobile devices or tablets (depending on user preference).

## Functionalities: 
+ As a professor i can define an activity at a particular date, with a description  and a unique access code for the activity. The activity is accessible for a set period of time.

+ As a student, i can input a code to participate in a defined activity. The code can be used for the duration of the activity.

+ As a student who has accessed an activity I have access to an interface split into 4 rectagles each containing an emoticon (smiley face, frowny face, surprised face, confused face). At any time i can press an emoticon to react to the activity. As a student I can add an unlimited number of feedback instances.

+ As a professor I can see the continuous feedback stream, with each feedback instance associated to the time it was generated at. I can only see the feedback as anonymous. For myself the feedback is available both during and after the activity.

### Backend:

	npm install --save body-parser -> for parsing JSON objects

	npm i --save morgan -> for tracking any request the server is getting || the request is shown in the terminal

	npm i --save-dev nodemon -> automatically restart the server when you modify something in the files
							 -> in the package.json I added a start script "start": "nodemon server.js"
			 				 -> just type npm start and the server starts and refreshes by itself

	npm install --save express -> for using express in our project

### Frontend:
	npm i create-react-app -g
